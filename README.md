# Pomodoro-Timer

This project helped me to pratice my newly-learned skills in React. Using JavaScript, I was able to build this project, which is designed as a productivity tool for tracking time spent on tasks, giving small breaks between each work period. As each timer comes to its conclusion, an alert is given to the user.

To run the application:

>Fork and clone the repo
 
>npm i
 
>npm start
